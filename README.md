# SmartCard
SmartCard is an iOS RealityKit application designed to put card managment to rest through the power of Augmented Reality. A modern problem with an even more modern solution.

## About
SmartCard is a tool that aims to redefine what a card can do. Using the quickly growing power of augmented reality, our application is able to put custom, informative overlays on some of the most frequently used cards in circulation. Whether it be a gift card, your Comet Card, or even your credit/debit cards, SmartCard can enhance the information gleaned with a quick and seamless scan from your phone. When shown a card in the camera view, SmartCard displays several useful pieces of information as well as further hyperlinks (as demonstrated in the demo). It gives valuable insight into the usage of your cards so as to enable better decisions in the future.

## Inspiration
According to a study conducted by Experian, the average American carries four cards in his/her wallet. And this tally is not including the various forms of identification nor the plethora of gift cards that inevitably make their way into the mess. The truth is, cards have become a staple of our everyday lives. We use them to send gifts, make online purchases, buy food, exchange information, among many other uses. But the physical cards themselves are rather limited. We carry them around everywhere just as we do our phones, but at least our phones have apps that serve various functionalities. The physical cards on the other hand are limited in that they display only the card number, expiration date, and CVV. Such a ubiquitous item should be able to do more. It should be smarter. Enter SmartCard.

## What It's Built With
The app was developed using a variety of tools. The backend and frontend was done on Swift, with the models being configured on Apple's RealityComposer application. The app currently runs on iOS only.

## What's Next for SmartCard
As SmartCard continues to develop, we will extend support to a variety of different commonly used cards. Any time that a user attempts to scan a gift card that is not currently supported, they can submit a request upon which the dev team will be able to manually add in the needed backend links. In addition, we will improve the image recognition algorithm to work in low light conditions. The goal is for this app to be integrated into the daily lives of people like the flashlight app, for example. Easy, simple, fast. In addition, we are working on adding support for Android as well.

## Awards
SmartCard placed first in two categories at HackUTD VII out of 330+ teams, winning $1500 in prizes.
